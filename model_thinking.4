Section 4 - Intro to Decision Making
====================================

how people make decisions
how people should make decisions

multi-criterion models
spatial models
decision making under uncertainty

these models have two uses
	normative - make us better at deciding
	positive - predict the behavior of others

two broad classes of models
	multi-criterion
		lots of dimensions
		choose one alternative vs another
		e.g. feature comparisons

	probabilistic
		uncertainty of outcomes
		how to balance risk vs reward
		e.g. graph feature X vs feature Y
			how far is each choice from the ideal point?

making decisions under uncertainty
	don't know how the features will unfold
	decision trees

	decision trees can also tell us the value of information


Multi-criterion Decision Making
-------------------------------

feature comparison chart - criteria vs options
	list allof your criteria
	which alternative wins for each criteria?

	criteria	O1	O2
	---------------------------
	C1		X
	C2			X
	C3			X

two approaches
	qualitative - simple criterion count
		for each criterion, best option gets a point
		rank based on # of points
	quantitative - weighted criterion count - some criteria mean more than others
		add a multiplier (M) to each criterion
		for each criterion, best option gets M points
		rank based on # of points

Q - Joanne considered two cameras. Here are their relevant specifications. Camera A: Weight 8 ounces, Memory 12 MB, 5X Zoom, 2 inch screen Camera B: Weight 6 ounces, 10 MB memory, 4X Zoom, 1.5 inch screen What can we say about Joanne's decision making approach?

She uses quantitative methods and cares about zoom
She uses qualitative multi criterion decision making
She's irrational
She uses a quantitative approach and cares a lot about having a light camera

Assuming that less weight, more memory, more zoom power, and a bigger screen are better, then Camera B wins on three of the four criteria Therefore, she must use a quantitative model and care a lot about weight.

[This is either 
	wrong - since no weights are given, it is qualitative
	missing info - the weights were not included]


Spatial Choice Models
---------------------

measuring distance from an ideal point
	on a single dimensional scale, or
	a multi-dimensional space

single dimension
	make a scale mapping range of values for the criterion
	place each alternative on the scale based on its score/value for the criterion
		hot/cold, left/right, etc
	there is an ideal point on the scale
	best choice is the alternative closest to the ideal point

	Development/applications of the model
		Hotelling's location model 
		Down applied this to how people vote
			map candidate on a left vs right scale
			d1 = distance between voter and candidate 1
			d2 = distance between voter and candidate 2

		Gelman - Supreme Court conservativity
			not just a simple ranking - adds in data
				map conservativity score (Y-axis) for each participant (SC Justice)
				do this for multiple points in time (each SC session) on X-axis

Multi-dimensional mapping
	burger attributes
		attribute	ideal	O1	D1	O2	D2
		----------------------------------------------------
		cheese		2	2	0	2	0
		patties		2	2	0	1	1
		tomatoes	2	0	2	2	0
		catsup		4	3	1	3	1
		mayo		4	4	0	4	0
		pickles		4	6	2	4	0

		these attributes would be modeled as six dimensions
			a vector of length 6

	list each criterion and its ideal value/score
	for each alternative	
		score the alternative at each criterion (O1, O2)
		calculate the difference (absolute value) from ideal for each criterion (D1, D2)
		sum the differences as the distance from the ideal
	best choice (closest to ideal) is lowest sum	

	use this normatively e.g. to determine who to vote for
		positions on issues
	use this positively to infer some person's ideal point e.g. burgers example
		if someone chose O1, then we can infer that
			they prefer two patties, or
			they don't like tomatoes, or
			they really like pickles, or
			some combination of these
			(ignore criteria where there is no difference among alternatives)

	Development/applications of the model
		dw-nominate mapping members of Congress on 2D L/R plane

	(Additional thoughts)
		you can also weight each ideal

		this is a one-dimensional representation on n-dimensional space
			each criterion is added as another dimension
				e.g. cars - speed vs comfort
			there is an ideal point in this multi-dimensional space

use this model to decide what to buy, who to vote for...
	how close are the alternatives to the ideal point?
	normative
apply the models to data
	where are SC Justices or Members of Congress ideologically? (across one or more dimensions)
	determine people's product preferences based on purchasing decisions
	positive

Q - Jim has spatial preferences over ice cream cones. He cares about the height of the cone in inches and the number of scoops. He chooses a three scoops on a four inch cone over either a double scoop on a seven inch cone or four scoops on a two inch cone, Which of the following could be his ideal point? (assume that he computes the distance from each option to his ideal point).

3 scoops, 5 inch cone
1 scoop, 8 inch cone
2 scoops, 4 inch cone
11 scoops, 3 inch cone

crit	ideal	O1	O2	O3
scoops		3	2	4
cone		4	7	2

A - He prefers (3,4) to (2,7) and (4,2). If his ideal point were (3,5), his distance to (3,4) would be 2 [this is wrong, the distance from (3,4) to (3,5) is 1]. His distance to (2,7) and (4,2) would be much larger. So (3,5) is possible. (1,8) is not possible as it's closer to (2,7). He would have chosen the two scoops on the seven inch cone. By similar logic (2,4) is possible, but (11,3) is not. If his ideal point was (11,3), he'd have chosen (4,2)


Probability: The Basics
-----------------------

Decision making under uncertainty
	need to consider probabilities of criteria, outcomes

probability -the odds of something happening

3 axioms of probability
	1) 0 ≤ P ≤ 1
		Probability of an outcome is in the range [0,1]
		if something can't happen, P = 0
		if something is certain to happen, P = 1
	2) Σ P = 1
		Sum of all possible outcomes equals one
		have to make a distinction between outcomes and events
			an outcome is an individual thing that can happen
			an event is a subset of outcomes
	3) A ⊆ B ⇒ P(B) ≥ P(A)
		If event A is a subset of event B, the probability of B is greater than the probability of A
		e.g. flippng a coin
			A = {H}, B = {H,T}
			P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 1

3 types of probability
	1) classical probability - all possible outcomes are known, and equally likely
		we know why a probability is what it is
		dice, coins, cards, lotteries
		P(a) = F/N
		e.g. roll a die
			P(4) = 1/6, P(even) = 3/6, P(odd) = 3/6
	2) Relative Frequency - # possible outcomes (n) is so large that we cannot know all of them
		we count occurrences of an event within a sample 
		P(a) = observed f / observed n
		e.g. are there more words that begin with r, or that have ras the 3rd letter?
		e.g. will it rain on June 7th?
			look up weather for last 100 years
				P(rain) = F/100 - (F = # times it rained on June 7th)
			requries an assumption that nothing has changed over that period of time
	3) Subjective probability
		a) estimates based on guessing
			!!! observe the three axioms when guessing !!!
				(Axiom 2 might not have applied in the student example, 
				unless we were told that one of the choices was the correct answer)
		b) estimates determined via models

		e.g. will housing prices go up this year?
			guess - 30%

Q - If you flip a fair coin and roll a six sided die, what's the probability of getting neither a HEAD or a 3?

5 out of 12
1 out of 6
4 out of 12
1 out of three

A - This means that you have to get a tail (probability 0.5) and get something other than a three (probability 5/6). Therefore we have to multiply those two events and we get 5/12. You can also get this answer by enumerating all possibilities and counting up al the cases where you have a tail and no three. These are T1,T2, T4, T5, and T6.
